// SPI Flash memory library for arduino/moteino.
// This works with 256byte/page SPI flash memory
// For instance a 4MBit (512Kbyte) flash chip will have 2048 pages: 256*2048 = 524288 bytes (512Kbytes)
// Minimal modifications should allow chips that have different page size but modifications
// DEPENDS ON: Arduino SPI library
// > Updated Jan. 5, 2015, TomWS1, modified writeBytes to allow blocks > 256 bytes and handle page misalignment.
// > Updated Feb. 26, 2015 TomWS1, added support for SPI Transactions (Arduino 1.5.8 and above)
// > Selective merge by Felix after testing in IDE 1.0.6, 1.6.4

///            it can only transition from 1s to 0s and only the erase command can reset all 0s to 1s
///            See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory
///            The smallest range that can be erased is a sector (4K, 32K, 64K); there is also a chip erase command

///            Release Power-down / Device ID (ABh), per section 8.2.19 of the W25X40CL datasheet.
///            This means after using the sleep() function of this library, wake() must be the first
///            function called. If other commands are used, the flash chip will ignore the commands.
